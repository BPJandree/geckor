`geckor` is an R client for the public [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api#explore-api). This package implements a
number of major endpoints offered by that API and allows one to collect the
current and historical market data on over 7000 cryptocurrencies from more than 400 exchanges. Results are typically returned in a tabular form as tibbles, ready for any downstream analyses.

## Installation

At the moment, `geckor` is only available on GitHub and can be installed with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("next-game-solutions/geckor")
```

## Examples

Detailed examples of how to use `geckor` can be found in its [online documentation](https://next-game-solutions.github.io/geckor/). Provided below are just a few common queries:


```{r example, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=10, fig.height=4.5}
library(geckor)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Get the current price of Cardano, Tron, and Polkadot,
# expressed in USD, EUR, and GBP:
current_price(coin_ids = c("cardano", "tron", "plokadot"),
              vs_currencies = c("usd", "eur", "gbp"))

# Get a more comprehensive view of the current Cardano, Tron, and 
# Polkadot markets:
current_market(coin_ids = c("cardano", "tron", "polkadot"), 
               vs_currency = "usd") %>% 
  glimpse()

# Collect all historical data on the price of Cardano (expressed in EUR),
# and plot the result:
cardano_history <- coin_history(coin_id = "cardano", 
                                vs_currency = "eur", 
                                days = "max")

cardano_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(timestamp, price)) +
  geom_line() + theme_minimal()
```
